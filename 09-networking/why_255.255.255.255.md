# 🔹 Why IPv4 addresses look like 255.255.255.255 and not 500.500…

## IPv4 uses 32 bits total
- IPv4 = 4 bytes (8 bits × 4).
- Each part (octet) is exactly 8 bits.

## 🔹 8 bits can only count from 0 → 255
- Binary `00000000` = 0  
- Binary `11111111` = 255  

That’s the full range of values 8 bits can hold.

So each octet in IPv4 must be between **0 and 255**.  

👉 That’s why valid addresses look like:  
- `192.168.1.10`  
- `8.8.8.8`  
- `255.255.255.255`  

❌ Numbers like `500.500.500.500` or `1000.2000.3000.4000` are impossible — they don’t fit into 8-bit bytes.

---

## 🔹 Why not something like 100.100… everywhere?
Because the designers wanted **binary efficiency**:  
- Each octet = 1 byte = 8 bits.  
- Easy for computers to process.  
- Fits perfectly into 32 bits (4 bytes).  

👉 If they allowed `500`, you’d need at least **9 bits per octet**, which would break the neat 32-bit design.

---

## 🔹 Special role of 255.255.255.255
- This is the **all-broadcast address** in IPv4.  
- All 32 bits = 1.  
- Means *“send to everyone in the local network.”*

---

## ✅ In short:
- IPv4 chose **255 as the limit** because each address part is **1 byte (8 bits)** → max value = 255.  
- That’s why we can’t have `500.500.500.500`.  

---

## 🔹 Extra Notes (bits & range)
- 1 **bit** = 0 or 1.  
- 1 **octet** = 8 bits = 1 byte.  
- With 8 bits → \(2^8 = 256\) possibilities.  

Range:  
- `00000000` = 0  
- `11111111` = 255  

👉 So octets always go **0–255**.

---

✅ IPv4 = 4 octets × 8 bits = 32 bits = 4 bytes.  
That's why IPv4 is called a **32-bit address system**.
